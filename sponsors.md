<center><h1>Sponsors For Social Engineering Village, NullCon 2018</h1></center><br>

With the advent of information overload and human involvement in corporate decision making, social engineering has become a practical threat. The social engineering village is an attempt to spread awareness regarding the dangers of this and promote proactive defences around this prevalent attack technique. 

> We proudly announce our Sponsor who helped further the cause and awareness for the Village
