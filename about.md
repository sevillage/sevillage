Social Engineering Village is the first of its kind event in the info-sec scene in India. The event is a dynamic platform for understanding and applying the art and science of social engineering and come face to face with the advancements in this domain.

The village is the platform that promotes talks, discussions, hands on Demos, workshops and CTF with primary focus on use of social engineering techniques in information security. <br><br>We are excited to encourage like minded individuals and groups and intend to spread the awareness around social engineering, phishing,
Reconnaissance, Red Teaming, frauds and defences against these attacks.
